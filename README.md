# Welcome to the Bit Fight Friday Challenge!

Back in 2022, we embarked on a challenge: make an apple fall from a tree and have ice cream fall from the sky. As wacky as that sounds, it was a cool learning experience.

It was so silly, we even published the game to Roblox. Feel free to play it here: https://www.roblox.com/games/11600613627/Bit-Fight-Friday

Feel free to download this project so you can learn from it, adapt it in your own games, etc. Who knows? Maybe it will help you out with your next game design adventure!
This code was created using Roblox Studio, which can be downloaded here: https://create.roblox.com/

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The code does NOT implement debouncing. This means that every time the apple is eaten, when a player steps on the green platform before the apple respawns, an error is thrown in the output. 
Use this project as an opportunity to learn why debouncing matters. To learn more on how to implement it, Roblox has a helpful tutorial: https://create.roblox.com/docs/scripting/debounce
